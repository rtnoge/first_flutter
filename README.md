# first_flutter

A new Flutter project.

I learned the fundamentals of Flutter from [BuildWithAngga](https://buildwithangga.com/kelas/flutter-mobile-apps) mentored by Rifqi Eka Hardianto & Angga Risky

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[Flutter documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
